# Instaclustr LDAP Authenticator

image:https://circleci.com/gh/instaclustr/cassandra-ldap.svg?style=svg["Instaclustr",link="https://circleci.com/gh/instaclustr/cassandra-ldap"]

This is a pluggable authentication implementation for Apache Cassandra, providing a way to authenticate
and create users based on a configured LDAP server. This implementation purely provides authentication only.
Role management must be performed through the usual Cassandra role management, CassandraAuthorizer.
See **How it works** for more details.

## Project structure & building

This project consists of 5 modules, `base` module is a module which all other implementation modules
depend on. It contains core implementation necessary so all concrete modules are just reusing it.

`base` module depends on Cassandra dependency of version 3.0.18 but its scope is `provided` as
these classes will be present when such plugin as a whole is put on a class path of Cassandra in runtime.

There are four implementation modules:

* cassandra-2.2 - builds against version 2.2.18
* cassandra-3.0 - builds against version 3.0.18
* cassandra-3.11 - builds against version 3.11.8
* cassandra-4.0 - builds against version 4.0-beta2

Project is built like:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

This does _not_ invoke integration tests. For integration tests to run, please specify `it` profile:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pit
```

Integration tests will expect a Docker installation present (or a way to connect to one), there
is a Docker container started with LDAP server running against which an integration test, per module,
is started.

## Configuration of plugin

After build, respective JAR to place to Cassandra `CLASSPATH` (e.g. by placing it to `libs` directory
of Cassandra installation) is located in `target` directory of each build as `casandra-ldap-{c* version}.jar`.
This JAR already contains artifact from `base` so you do not need to take care of it - one JAR is enough.
You may the most probably use a plugin built against a respective version for other Cassandra
versions of the same minor release so you might use 3.11.8 plugin for 3.11.4, for example.

The configuration is ridden by configuration file and system property you need to start Cassandra with
to point that plugin to a configuration file to read properties from.

The system property is `-Dcassandra.ldap.properties.file=/path/to/configiration.properties`. If
not set, it will try to resolve `$CASSANDRA_CONF/ldap.properties`.

The content of the configuration file is as following:


|===
|property name |explanation

|ldap_uri
|Ldap server URI. Specify ldaps when using a secure LDAP port (strongly recommended), example: `ldap://127.0.0.1:389/dc=example,dc=org`

|context_factory
|defaults to `com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory`

|anonymous_access
|Anonymous access on LDAP server. If this is true you don't need a service user (not recommended)

|service_dn
|Service user distinguished name. This user will be a SUPERUSER and be used for looking up user details on authentication, example: `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org`

|service_password
|Service user password

|ldap_naming_attribute
|Use this setting if you need to change your naming attribute from the usual cn=

|auth_cache_enabled
|relevant for Cassandra 3.11 and 4.0 plugins, defaults to `false`

|auth_bcrypt_gensalt_log2_rounds
|number of rounds to hash passwords
|===


## Configuration of Cassandra

If is *strongly* recommended to use `NetworkTopologyStrategy` for your `system_auth keyspace`.


Please be sure that `system_auth` keyspace uses `NetworkTopologyStrategy` with number of replicas equal to number of nodes in DC. If it is not
the case, you can alter your keyspace like:

    ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': '3'}  AND durable_writes = true;

After this, repair `system_auth` keyspace so it all propagates to other nodes.

They you need to restart your cluster in a rolling fashion. For each node, you need to put this configuration
into `cassandra.yaml` for each node:

### Cassandra 2.2

```
authenticator: Cassandra22LDAPAuthenticator
role_manager: LDAPCassandraRoleManager
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer
```

### Cassandra 3.0

```
authenticator: Cassandra30LDAPAuthenticator
role_manager: LDAPCassandraRoleManager
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer
```

### Cassandra 3.11

```
authenticator: LDAPAuthenticator
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer
role_manager: LDAPCassandraRoleManager
```

### Cassandra 4.0

```
authenticator: LDAPAuthenticator
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer
role_manager: LDAPCassandraRoleManager
```

For 3.11 and 4, configure credential caching parameters in `cassandra.yaml` if necessary and if you want
that cache to be enabled (as per configuration parameters). [Re]start Cassandra.


## Example

For fast testing there is Debian OpenLDAP Docker container

    docker run -e LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --rm -d -p 389:389 --name ldap1 osixia/openldap

The `ldap.configuration` file in `conf` directory does not need to be changed and with the above `docker run`, it will work out of the box. You just
have to put it in `$CASSANDRA_CONF` or set respective configuration propery as described above.

## How it works

LDAPAuthenticator currently supports plain text authorisation requests only in the form of a username and password.
This request is made to the LDAP server over plain text, so you should be using client encryption on the Cassandra
side and secure ldap (ldaps) on the LDAP side.

Credentials are sent from your client to the Cassandra server and then tested against the LDAP server for
authentication using a specified service account. This service account should be configured in the `ldap.properties`
file using the `service_dn` and `service_password` properties. If `service_dn` is set, such role will be created in database,
when not already present, upon node's start.

`service_dn` account which will be automatically created will be super user in Cassandra.

All "normal" roles are not affected they behave exactly as you are used to.

If LDAP server connection is lost or there is other communication error while talking to LDAP server,
operator has still a possibility to log in via `cassandra` user as usually and until LDAP server is not back again,
users meant to be authenticated against LDAP server will not be able to log in but all "normal" users will be able to
login and the disruption of LDAP communication will not affect their ability to do so as they live in Cassandra natively.

In case there are two logins of same name (e.g. `admin` in LDAP and `admin` in C*),
in order to distinguish them, if you want to login with LDAP user, you have to
specify its full account name, e.g

    cqlsh -u cn=admin,dn=example,dn=org

In case user specifies just `admin` as login name (or any other name, for that matter), it will try to
authenticate against database first and if not successful, against LDAP, adding all details (cn= etc ...) to username automatically.

It is possible to delete administration role (e.g. role `cassandra`) but if one does that, all administration operations are possible to
be done only via LDAP account. In case LDAP is down, operator would not have any control over DB as `cassandra` is not present anymore.
In such case, it is recommended to create another admin-like user with strong password _before_ `cassandra` role is deleted. Plugin is internally creating new roles
when somebody from LDAP logs in and it is not in DB yet - for this functionality, there needs to be some admin-like user which writes them `system_auth.roles` table.
If you delete `cassandra` user, there is suddenly not such user. You have to restart node and specify this property

    -Dcassandra.ldap.admin.user=dba

Where `dba` is _new_ superuser which is able to write to `system_auth.roles` and acts as Cassandra admin.
