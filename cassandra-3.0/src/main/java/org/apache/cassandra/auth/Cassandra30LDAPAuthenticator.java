/**
 * Uses JNDI to authenticate to an LDAP server. On successful authentication a Cassandra role is created for the provided
 * user. This user is configured without a password, so if you disable Authenticator or switch Authenticator any user
 * will be usable by anyone (this is no different to switching a single node to AllowAllAuthenticator).
 *
 * Users that are disabled in LDAP can only be cleaned up manually, however this is not typically necessary as long as you
 * keep using LDAPAuthenticator, they will just needlessly fill up system_auth. As long as they are disabled in your LDAP
 * server, they cannot be authenticated with Cassandra.
